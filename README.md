# Unity Projects

This repo contains some of the game ideas/mechanics that I am currently trying out. I will be updating them irregularly but frequently. I will provide a basic description of each project below.


## First-Person Platformer

A snappy and quick platformer with wall running and sliding mechanics with a first-person perspective. The main focus is on getting the movement to be as crisp and satisfying as possible. After the movement system is complete, I will work on adding standard FPS combat while focusing on making the player use the movement system to create satisfying kills/tricks.
